# Health-Mangement-System

PROJECT OVERVIEW:

As a passionate and driven developer, I've created a Health Management System in Java to demonstrate my technical prowess in 
data management and software engineering. This personal project showcases my ability to work with data structures, optimize algorithms, 
and implement robust exception handling.

KEY FEATURES:

Optimized Data Handling: Leveraging my skills in my data structure course, I've designed an efficient array-based structure to manage 
health records extracted from CSV files. This demonstrates my ability to create performant solutions for data management.

Exception Handling Expertise: Exception handling is a critical aspect of software development, and I've implemented comprehensive 
error-handling mechanisms to ensure the system's reliability and stability, illustrating my proficiency in mitigating potential 
issues.
